	Abstract = {{The developer of the acclaimed Eiffel programming language comes
	through with one of the clearest and most informative books about
	computers ever committed to paper. <i>Object-Oriented Software Construction</i>
	is the gospel of object-oriented technology and it deserves to be
	spread everywhere. Meyer opens with coverage of the need for an object-oriented
	approach to software development, citing improved quality and development
	speed as key advantages of the approach. He then explains all the
	key criteria that define an object- oriented approach to a problem.
	Meyer pays attention to techniques, such as classes, objects, memory
	management, and more, returning to each technique and polishing his
	readers' knowledge of it as he explains how to employ it "well."
	In a section on advanced topics, Meyer explores interesting and relevant
	topics, such as persistent objects stored in a database. He also
	offers a sort of "Do and Don't" section in which he enumerates common
	mistakes and ways to avoid them. Management information isn't the
	main point of <i>Object-Oriented Software Construction</i>, but you'll
	find some in its pages. Meyer concludes his tour de force with comparisons
	of all the key object-oriented languages, including Java. He also
	covers the potential of simulating object technology in non-object-oriented
	languages, such as Pascal and Fortran. The companion CD-ROM includes
	the full text of this book in hypertext form, as well as some tools
	for designing object-oriented systems. If you program computers,
