\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro7}

This project describes a method to automatically generate program contracts using Daikon and increases the confidence of generated contracts using ESC/Java2. The random test case generator developed does not guarantee code coverage, but tuning it to generate large number of test cases produced strong and usable results on tested data structures. Contracts produced describe post conditions and frame conditions for each method and class invariants. Statically checking the suggested invariants using ESC/Java2 was less useful than expected because of strong assumptions about code which are made by ESC/Java, which resulted in high number of false negatives. The only way to efficiently use ESC/Java2â€™s capabilities is to annotate the code manually and evolve the annotations based on output of ESC/Java2, and it is not a good idea to use it to check automatically generated invariants without any user input.
