     \textbf{Defect:} 						& When the distinction between fault and failure is not critical, defect can be used as a generic term to refer to either a fault (cause) or a failure (effect). \\
     \textbf{Detection:} 					& Detection refers to the observation that the programs observed behavior differs from the expected behaviour.\\
     \textbf{Effectiveness:} 					& The number of defects found by a technique.\\
     \textbf{Efficiency:} 					& The amount of time taken by a technique to find a defect. In other words, it also specifies number of defects found by a technique in an hour.\\
     \textbf{Error:} 						& An incorrect or missing human action that result in software containing a fault (i.e. incorrect software)\\
     \textbf{Failure:} 						& An inability of a system to perform its required functions within specified requirements or to perform in an unexpected way.\\
     \textbf{Fault:} 						& An abnormal condition that may cause a reduction in, or loss of, the capability of a functional unit to perform a required function. It can also be defined as a requirements, design, or implementation flaw or deviation from a desired or intended state.\\
     \textbf{Isolation:} 						& Isolation means to reveal the root cause of the failure in the program.\\
     \textbf{Test case:} 					& A set of inputs, execution conditions, and a pass/fail criterion.\\
     \textbf{Test specification:} 		& It is a requirement to be satisfied by one or more test cases.\\
     \textbf{Test obligation:} 				& A partial test case specification, requiring some property deemed important to thorough testing.\\
     \textbf{Test execution:} 			& The activity of executing test cases and evaluating their results.\\
     \textbf{Test Plan:} 					& A document describing the estimation of the test efforts, approach, required resources and schedule of intended testing activities.\\

     \textbf{Validation:}  					& The process of evaluating the to determine whether it satisfies specified customer requirements.\\
     \textbf{Verification:}  					& The process of evaluating the software to determine whether it works according to the specified requirements.\\
