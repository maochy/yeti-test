This is the abstract text with the formula $v_L(t)=\int^t_{-\infty}
\frac{di_L}{dt}$. This paper describes the computation of feature
point correspondences using the spectra of a Hermitian property
matrix. Firstly, a complex Laplacian (Hermitian) matrix is
constructed from the Gaussian-weighted distances and the difference
of SIFT angles between each pair of points in the two images to be
matched. Matches are computed by comparing the complex eigenvectors
of the Hermitian property matrices for the two point sets acquired
from the two images. Secondly, we embed the complex modal structure
within Carcassoni's iterative alignment method to render it more
robust to rotation. Our method has been evaluated on both synthetic
and real-world data.
