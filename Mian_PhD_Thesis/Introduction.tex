Today, the primary focus of software companies is to achieve high quality. These companies spend an estimated thirty to ninety percent of the total software development cost on testing \ref{Beizer1990}, \ref{Standards2002}. 

Software testing is the process of executing a software with specific test data followed by evaluation of the results to check whether it is working according to its specification or not \ref{Sommerville2006}.
% check here if we can replace specification with oracle or not.
The test passes if the output complies to its specification and fails otherwise. The success of testing correlates with the number of failures found in the Software Under Test (SUT): a test is more successful if it finds more faults.

It is interesting that program testing is used to show the presence of bugs, rather than absence of bugs [6]. Therefore the SUT that passes all the tests without returning a single failure does not guarantee that there is no fault. The testing process increases however the reliability and confidence of both the developers and the users in the tested product [7] [8] [9].
Random testing is a black-box testing technique in which the SUT is executed against ran- domly selected test data. Test results obtained are compared either against the oracle defined, using SUT specifications in the form of assertions or exceptions defined by the programming language. The rapid increase in software development in today?s modern world prompts the need for automated testing to ensure high quality. The generation of random test data is com- paratively cheap and does not require too much intellectual and computation efforts [10] [11]. It is for this reason that various researchers have recommended this strategy for incorporation in automatic testing tools [12]. YETI [13] [14], AutoTest [15] [16], QuickCheck [17], Randoop [18], JArtage [19] are a few of the most common tools based on random strategy.
