1. Extend tool to check all Java primitive data types: Current implementation checks only those Java classes which use integer data types, integer arrays, other classes which are checked, or arrays of these classes. This restricts the usability of the developed tool. This can be solved by including checking for other Java primitive data types. 2. Include other Java features: Current implementation restricts classes to have only fields, methods, and constructors. To extend this tool to check all Java programs it is required to check all features offered by Java. 3. Experiment with other static checkers: Although ESC/Java2 is a powerful static checker it makes very strong assumptions about Java which results in warning of many of the correct invariants suggested by Daikon. A static checker which results in less number of false warnings is required. 4. Generate test cases which ensure code coverage: Current random test case generator does not guarantee code coverage which forces manual inspection of invariants generated to check if behavior of program is conveyed properly. The reliance on manual inspection can be reduced if test cases can guarantee code coverage.
